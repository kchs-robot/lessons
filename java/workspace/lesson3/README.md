# Lesson 3;

## First File

You'll want to make sure you have the [Java Autocompiler]("/kchs-robot/lessons/java/util/java-autocompiler") installed.
Make sure you read the "README.md" before pulling that file from github to download the necessary java runtimes.

Tasks:
- Create a new file "Main.java"
- Write the beginning class
- Create a new main submethod

Need Help? Try:

public class FILENAME {
  public static void main(String[] args){
    
  }
}
